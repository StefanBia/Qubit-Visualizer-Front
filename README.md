## About the Project

After taking the TUCN course on the basics of quantum computing, I have decided to create a way to facilitate the entry into the world of qubits, thus creating the Qubit Visualizer. I chose to make a Web Application to ensure widespread accessibility and visibility, allowing a broader audience to explore its features. My program of choice was React, which facilitated the implementation of the moving components in the project. I also opted for React because of its popularity among the developers nowadays. The interface is simple and easy to use, allowing users to create an account for saving their work, while also being engaging both for children and adults.

## Getting Started

By default the gate displayed is the Pauli-X gate, to change the gate, you can click on the buttons in the workbench on the bottom of the screen. Clicking the sign-in/sign-up buttons will open a model for connecting/creating an account.

### Prerequisites

Being in development, the user needs to have an IDE for running a react application like
WebStorm of VS Code. Having a web browser is also necessary.
### Installation

Clone the project from the GitHub repository. Open the application in your editor of choice and open a terminal window. Run the npm start command in the terminal, then the project should open in your browser automatically. 

## Usage

This Web Application was created with a sole educational purpose, being a friendly way of approaching a tough subject, without dealing with the tough math behind it.

## Contributing

This project is open for contributions, as well as improvement suggestions.


## Acknowledgements

I have to give credit to the TUCN for teaching me this subject, as well as the [Uranium](https://uranium.transilvania-quantum.org/)  platform and the [Quantum Odyssey](https://www.quarksinteractive.com/)  video game for being the inspiration of my work.
